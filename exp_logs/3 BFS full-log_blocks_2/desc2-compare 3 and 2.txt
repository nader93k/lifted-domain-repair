In 2 different runs on the block word (blocks/pprobBLOCKS-5-0-err-rate-0-5) we seen in sc1 and sc2 that Songtuan’s algorithm will randomly return different repairs and for the case that it is adding a positive effect instead of removing a precondition, the fringe size has grown faster and maybe that’s the reason that it has found a solution on #3554 instead of the other run which is not converged even after 6k?
