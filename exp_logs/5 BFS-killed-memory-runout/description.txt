When running the mega-run, the process got killed by the OS when we reached this problem: Instance ID=mprime/pprob17-err-rate-0-5
While the plan length is only 4, it seems that the number of action parameters and objects in the initial state are causing this.
I'll start to use memory limits or subprocesses to alleviate this.
