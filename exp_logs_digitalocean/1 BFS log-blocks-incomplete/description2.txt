# Summary
We fail to find any groundings for Stack (#4) because of the flaw: pick-up (#3) does not cause holding anything. 

# Songtuanâ€™s repairs:
unstack,(clear ?y),effPos,1
stack,(holding ?x),precPos,-1


# First 4 actions, we fail to produce the last one:
(unstack c e)
(put-down c)
(pick-up d)
(stack d c)



# The domain:
(:INIT
	(clear d) (clear c) (ontable d) (ontable a) (on c e) (on e b) (on b a)
	(handempty)
)


(:action unstack   c e
	:precondition (and
		(on c e)
		(clear c)
		(handempty ))
	:effect (and
		(holding c)
		(not (clear c))
		(not (handempty ))
		(not (on c e)))) )

(:action put-down   c
	:precondition (holding c)
	:effect (and
		(not (holding c))
		(clear c)

	:effect (and
